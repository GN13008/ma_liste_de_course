# Welcome to "Du Menu Ã  l'Assiette"

This is my first web app after LeWagon Bootcamp. The idea is to learn new concept and practise what I learned during LeWagon.
The concept is simple, I had the idea that a shopping list will be easier if we start with a list of all meals for the week.

So this is the MVP of this idea.

## Goals and achievement :
 - Practice my skills in Ruby on rails, Data Base and Design
 - OG graphe and meta of an app (In progress)
 - user mail validation (In progress) 

## Ways of evolutions :
 - have an acount and manage recipes (currently on the console / seed)
 - linked the list to a phone app of note
 - use this app to create API and linked it to a react / JS interface
 - ...
