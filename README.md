# Welcome to "Ma Liste de Course"

This is my first web app after LeWagon Bootcamp. The idea is to learn new concept and practise what I learned during LeWagon.

The concept is simple, I had the idea that a shopping list will be easier if we start with a list of all meals for the week.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
